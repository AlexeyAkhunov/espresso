# espresso

Espresso is described in great detail in the book of Giovanni De Micheli "Synthesis and Optimization of Digital Circuits" (1994)

I found the software [here](https://embedded.eecs.berkeley.edu/pubs/downloads/espresso/index.htm)
and made it compile with a modern compiler - the experience probably similar to fixing a vintage car until it starts running.
